Build DieHard.
Set LD_PRELOAD to libdiehard.so (not _r!).
Run your program (src/test/overflow.cpp)
Send your program SIGUSR1
The program will create a core file (DHcore-XXXX) in its CWD.
Repeat.
Build the patcher (src/patcher).
Set the environment variable DH_PATCHFILE to something (patch.test).
Run the patcher with two command line arguments (./patcher DHcore-XX DHcore-YY)
Run the program again (./overflow).
It will read the file specified by DH_PATCHFILE and behave "appropriately".
